### _Projects Eliminated_

#### - [Mindwerks/worldengine](https://github.com/Mindwerks/worldengine)

The project is mostly written in Python and is part of Mindwerks. 
Worldengine is a map generator that can be used to genertae covilizations. It has an MIT license which is a permissive license.
I would be interested in working on this open source project as I am fond of simulations and maps. 
Unfortunately, it seems that work on the project has mostly stopped as the last commit was in 2015 and the last issue was
open in 2018. While there are still 47 issues that are open, it is likely that due to the project community being inactive for so long, requests to solve issues may not be responded to for quite a long period of time. 

### _Projects Still Being Considered_

Brave browser is a chromium based web browser which I personally use and prefer to alternative browsers.
It has an active and friendly community.
