## __Vicky Brasseur's Presentation__

Vicky Brasseur's lecture slides in my opinion are eye-opening when it came to her thoughts on the Open Source Communtiy and some of the seldomly discussed negative characteristics of some project communties.

The slides on some FOSS projects not being the most newbie or non experienced programmer friendly was very informative in the sense that while I am aware that some communities are like this in the Open Source space, I was not aware how prevalent this is even though it does not characterize the majority of Open Source project development teams. 

I also agree with some of the suggestions put forward to make Open Source project communities less elitist and intimidating to newcomers to Open Source as well as inexperienced programmers. 


## __Code.gov__

I would be willing to work on some issues such as [Add Warning for Unsupported Browsers](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-front-end/issues/128) and possibly [Reduce Image Sizes](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-front-end/issues/870) for the GSA.
A Federal Government Open Source initiative in my opinion demonstrates the popularity and importance of Open Source in the fact that the the United States has taken the effort to promote Open Source.
