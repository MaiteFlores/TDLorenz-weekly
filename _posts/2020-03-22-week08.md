## __On The Current Situation of the World and the Coronavirus Pandemic:__

The  Corona Virus or COVID19 Pandemic has rapidly become a amjor issue of global prominence,
and for the US a probable major defining event of the 21st century socioeconomically.

I barely recall what 9/11 was like as I was around 3 and a half years old at the time.
While obviously this situation is quite differnet in terms of variables like
how long certain impacts it will have will last, it cannot be understated taht this will ceratinly have lasting 
societal and economic effects that echo perhaps ofr a few decades or more.

### __Regarding Online Learning:__

Based off of the first class session as well as some of my other class sessions, 
I believe so far things are going pretty well.

I think another one of the possible effects of this pandemic is that online learning and remote woking will become more widely recognized and accepted as viable alternatives to commuting to work and attending class in non-virtual classrooms and 
offices at least for teh lines of work wher this was already doable.
