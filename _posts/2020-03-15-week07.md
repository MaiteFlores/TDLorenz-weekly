## __Open Source Is Not About You__

The article [Open Source is Not About You](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9)
details the author Rich Hickey's opinion of why he thinks open source in practice is not something one should expect to derive rewards from for contributing. He argues that expecting rewards such as gratitude and recognition and is futile from working in open source. 

I am of the opinion that this a good goal to try to attain, that is not not expecting to get anything out of attempting to add something to an open sourc project. However, I find it unrealistic that this goal is something that everyone wanting to contrbute to open source projects would agree with. I would postulate that there are many people who indeed want to gain something out of working on an open source project whether it be prestige, experiece, or even credentials to use in trying to apply for jobs. While achieving this at least all of the time when contributing is not realistic for some, I thinmk that if some contributors were to stop achieving these things they would probably not continue to work on open source projects.
